## How to use the vault
The vault contains a number of different tasks which are supposed to help users to familiarise themselves with Obsidian and start building their own personal knowledge management system. These tasks can be completed in self-study; for those that require producing a specific output, solutions are provided that will allow users to self-assess.

Users should start from `Getting started with Obsidian.md` and complete the tasks of the core programme in the indicated order. Afterwards, the tasks of the optional programme can be completed in an order of the user's choice.
