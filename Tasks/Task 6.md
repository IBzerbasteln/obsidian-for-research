# Creating and using templates
> [!info] Introduction
> The use of templates in Obsidian is useful for two reasons: (1) templates make it easier to **maintain consistency** across notes, and (2) they **save a lot of time**. Working with templates is particularly beneficial for recurring note types like meeting notes, daily notes, or literature notes.
> 
> This task will teach you how to create and use templates in Obsidian.

## Learning outcomes
By the end of this task, you will be able to:
- create a new template in Obsidian;
- customize it to fit your needs; and
- use it to create new notes.

## Instructions
### Creating a template
1. **Create a Templates folder**: Open the menu pane on the left and click on the folder icon at the top to create a new folder named `Templates`. 
2. **Specify Templates folder**: Open the settings and go to `Core Plugins` > `Templates` > `Template Folder Location`. Select the folder you just created. 
3. **Create a new template**: Create a new note in the `Templates` folder (`Ctrl+N`) and assign a descriptive name to it, like `Literature Note Template`.^[NB: The template note needs to be located in the Templates folder so that the Templates plugin can detect and apply it.]
4. **Customise the template**: Add the structure and content you want to include in your template. For a meeting note, that could include a Metadata section which contains the title, author(s), date, and abstract of a source, and another section for your annotations.

### Using a template
1. **Create a new note**: Create a new note in Obsidian (`Ctrl+N`) and give it a title.
2. **Apply the template**: Use the command palette (`Ctrl+P`) to search for and select the `Templates: Insert template` command. This will show you a list of the available templates in the `Templates` folder. Choose the template you created earlier; Obsidian will paste it into your current note.^[NB: You can apply templates to any note, not just a recently created one. Obsidian will then simply paste the template at the point where your cursor is when you execute the command.]
3. **Fill in the details**: Fill in the details of the new note using the structure provided by the template.
