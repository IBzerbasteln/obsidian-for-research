# Recording your daily activities
> [!info] Introduction
> Keeping track of what you're doing every day is a great way of tracking your own progress and saves time whenever you need to write a report about your work, e.g., for an annual appraisal. The Daily Notes plugin in Obsidian can help with that: it automatically creates a note every day for you to log your activities for the day.
>
> This task will teach you how to use daily notes to record what you're working on.

## Learning outcomes
By the end of this task, you will be able to:
- create a Daily Note template in Obsidian;
- adjust the naming and; 
- use it to to log your daily activities.

## Instructions
1. **Create a Daily Notes folder**: The Daily Notes plugin will automatically put the daily notes in a specified folder. If you don't want them to get mixed with your other notes, open the folder menu and create a new folder named `Daily Notes`.
2. **Create a Daily Note template**: Having a common structure in all your daily notes helps keeping them consistent and not forget anything important. Create a new note (`Ctrl+N`/`Cmd+N`) named `Daily Note Template`, enter the things you would like to track/record, and move it to the `Templates` folder.^[For a comprehensive explanation on how to create and use templates cf. [[Task 6]]]
	- Possible sections can include `Tasks`, `Meetings`, `Goals`, `Insights`, `Follow-up` etc.
	- Even just a unified header can improve consistency a lot.
3. **Customise settings**: Open the settings and go to `Core Plugins` > `Daily Notes`.
	1. For the second point, specify the `Daily Notes` folder you created earlier as the target folder.
	2. For the third point, select the `Daily Note Template` you just created.
	3. If you would like a different standardised name for your daily notes than the default (`YYYY-MM-DD`), you can specify that under the first point.
4. **Create a daily note**: There are two ways of creating a daily note:
	1. by clicking on the calendar icon on the left menu; and
	2. opening the command palette (`Ctrl+P`/`Cmd+P`) to search for and select the `Daily Notes: Open today's daily note` command.

> [!tip] Plugin Recommendation
>  For a more elaborate logging scheme, check out the [Periodic Notes plugin](https://github.com/liamcain/obsidian-periodic-notes) that also implements weekly notes, monthly notes, quarterly notes, and yearly notes.
