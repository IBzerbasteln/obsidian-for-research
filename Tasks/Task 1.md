# Formatting your notes using Markdown
> [!info] Introduction
>  Obsidian is a note-taking app that uses the [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format. **Markdown** is a simple way to format text using plain text symbols. It's like a shorthand for formatting that you can use to make your notes look nice without having to use complicated software or editing options.
>  
>  This task will teach you how to use it!

## Learning outcomes
By the end of this task, you will be able to:
- understand the basics of Markdown syntax;
- use Markdown to format your notes in Obsidian; and
- replicate an example PDF using Markdown in Obsidian.

## Instructions
1. Create a new note (`Ctrl+N`) with the title `Task 1_Practice`. You can also create and access that note by clicking on [[Task 1_Practice|this link]].
2. Open the [[Task 1_Example.pdf|example PDF]] in a new tab and use drag-and-drop to arrange them side by side.

3. Follow the example PDF provided and replicate its content and formatting using Markdown. 
	- You can copy and paste the text but you will need to accurately format it yourself.
	- Use the references below to figure out how to create different formatting options in Markdown.
	- If you right-click on selected text or in the editor, this will display the different formatting options, too.
4. Once you've finished formatting your note, check the [[Task 1_Solution]] to compare your result. What is the same, what is different? And does that matter in practice?
