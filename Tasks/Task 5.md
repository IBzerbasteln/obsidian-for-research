# Changing the appearance of your vault
> [!info] Introduction
> In order for working in Obsidian to be enjoyable, many people find it important for the app to look nice. If you don't like the standard appearance of Obsidian, there's good news for you: users in the Obsidian community have created hundreds of different looks that cater to (almost) any aesthetic you could think of.
> 
> This task will teach you how to change the appearance of your Obsidian vault using themes and custom CSS.

## Learning outcomes
By the end of this task, you will be able to:
- install and switch between different themes in Obsidian;
- enable and configure appearance settings in Obsidian; and
- know about the possibility to customize the appearance of your vault with CSS.

## Instructions
### Installing and switching themes
1. **Open Settings**: Click on the settings icon in the lower-left corner of Obsidian to open the settings menu.
2. **Navigate to Appearance**: In the settings menu, go to the `Appearance` section.
3. **Select and apply a theme**: In the `Themes` section, click on the `Manage` button. This will take you to the repository of all themes that are available for Obsidian. Browse the list; you can click on any theme to preview it. Once you've found one you would like to try, click `Install and use`.

> [!info] Configuring Appearance Settings
> In addition to switching themes, there are a few general settings about how your Obsidian looks that you can adjust (e.g., the font size or what menus are shown). These can be found in the `Appearance` section in the `Settings`. 

### Good to know: CSS Customisation
> [!warning] Coding skills required
> CSS stand for Cascading Style Sheets and refers to code that influences how your Markdown or HTML text is displayed. They allow you to customise the look of your vault with a large degree of precision and customisation but require at least a general understanding of how the code works, even if you are using [CSS snippets written by other people](https://github.com/r-u-s-h-i-k-e-s-h/Obsidian-CSS-Snippets/tree/Collection). 
> 
> CSS customisation is entirely optional and to 99% a matter of aesthetics. It will not make you any more productive and is an easy way of losing a lot of time without getting much out of it. Tread carefully.

1. **Open Appearance settings**: Click on the settings icon in the lower-left corner of Obsidian go to the `Appearance` section.
2. **Add a CSS snippet**: Click on the `Open snippets folder` button to open the folder where you can add your custom CSS files. Now, you can either:
	- create a new `.css` file and add your custom CSS code; or
	- use a `.css` file [from the Internet](https://github.com/r-u-s-h-i-k-e-s-h/Obsidian-CSS-Snippets/tree/Collection) and paste it into the folder.
3. **Enable CSS snippets**: Under the `CSS snippets` tab, toggle the switch to enable CSS snippets. The enabled snippets will then be applied to your vault.
