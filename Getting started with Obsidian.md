## Introductory Note
Dear fellow PhDs,

Welcome to the first day of the rest of your research career! You've made the commendably wise decision to spend a little bit of time trying out a tool that might save you lots of time, energy, and worry during your remaining PhD trajectory and perhaps after.

I am, of course, talking about **Obsidian**, a free, open source, community first note-taking app. People use it for all kinds of different purposes ranging from [academic research](https://medium.com/@alexandraphelan/an-updated-academic-workflow-zotero-obsidian-cffef080addd) over [creative writing](https://storyletter.substack.com/p/to-build-a-note-is-note-taking-productive) to [role-playing games](https://phd20.com/blog/getting-started-with-obsidian-dnd/) like *Dungeons and Dragons*. In our line of work, the capacity of Obsidian to store, organise, and connect knowledge is extremely powerful, and I would like you to explore this; maybe you will find it valuable.

For that purpose, I've designed a few tasks to help you get started with Obsidian on your own device. Everything you need to complete them is already in the vault---apart from the thoughts, notes, and materials that you would like to keep and curate in Obsidian. The tasks from the **core programme** should be completed in the given order; after that, you can (if you like) turn to the **optional programme** in whatever order. 

At the bottom of this page, you'll also find some references if ever you're interested in pushing your Obsidian use any further.

Enjoy the exploration!
Paul

## Tasks
> [!tip] Usage note
> The tasks are designed to be completed in Reading Mode. When you open them, click on the book icon in the top-right corner. Once it turns into a pen, you're in Reading Mode. 

### core programme
1. [[Task 1]]: Formatting your notes using Markdown
2. [[Task 2]]: Getting your notes into Obsidian and linking them
3. [[Task 3]]: Taking reading notes in Obsidian

### optional programme
- [[Task 4]]: Recording your daily activities
- [[Task 5]]: Changing the appearance of your vault
- [[Task 6]]: Creating and using templates
- [[Task 7]]: Structuring your vault

### and then?
The purpose of these tasks is to help you **familiarise yourself** with Obsidian and put a few things in place that will allow you to get started and lose the fear of a new tool. This is, however, not the important part. Having a clean, beautiful, optimised vault is completely pointless if you don't do work in it. This is a tool, not an end in itself. The important part comes now: **start taking notes**. Just start. Now. Completing the tasks will give you a minimal environment where you can get a lot of things done; everything else you can figure out along the way. Just give it a try. And if you want to develop your vault, add more functionalities, refine your workflow etc., I've added a list of resources below to get you started.

Remember: this is your system, and it can be as advanced or as vanilla as you want. The important thing is that it works for you, and does the things you want it to do. It's a tool, not an end in itself. And one last thing: stay critical when you watch Obsidian tutorials and showcases on YouTube. There is a lot of extremely valuable content out there but also a lot of people who make content for a living and therefore have to keep making up problems and selling you solutions to "Supercharge your Productivity in Obsidian üß†". Be wary of these, and be guided by your own functional needs and capabilities.

I wish you all the best for your Obsidian journey---and if you feel like discussing any of this further, you can reach me via paul.stewens@maastrichtuniversity.nl.
